The Arabic Language has been around for well over 1000 years. It is considered to have originated in the Arabian Peninsula. It was first spoken by nomadic tribes in the northwestern frontier of the Peninsula.
Arabic, which is the native tongue of more than 200 million people worldwide, ranks 6th among the major languages of the world.
Arabic belongs to the Semitic family of languages, which also includes Hebrew, Aramaic, and Phoenician.
Over the centuries of its existence, the Arabic language has adopted words from other languages including Hebrew, Aramaic, Persian, Greek, English and French. It has also influenced other languages as well including Turkish, Bengali, Hindi, Indonesian and Tagalog.
Ya'rab is regarded as the Father of the Arabic Language. The justification for this is the simple fact that he is counted amongst the oldest speakers of the Arabic language. He has also written various literary notes and works in Arabic.
Arabic is another language with a non-Latin alphabet. There are also characteristics of spoken Arabic that make it hard to learn. Some of the sounds used don't exist in other languages or are simply unfamiliar to English speakers, including sounds made in the back of your throat.
Probably one of the unique things about the Arabic language is that the words always begin with a consonant, followed by a vowel. This is much unlike many words in the English language that have two consonants in succession, sometimes even having silent letters. The Arabic alphabet comprises 28 letters.
