		<h3>
	Monterey Bay is on the central coast of California, just two hours south of San Francisco. The bay itself is one of the largest marine protected areas in the world and home to whales, deep sea anglerfish, and of course our mascot, sea otters. The CSUMB campus is close to pristine beaches, redwood forests, tidepools, and the Fort Ord National Monument.
    The campus sits halfway between the Monterey Peninsula, which features the coastal communities of Pacific Grove, Monterey, Seaside and Carmel, and the Salinas Valley, known as the "Salad Bowl of the World"for its abundant agricultural production. The city of Salinas is the county seat and served as the setting for many of John Steinbeck's novels.
    The campus straddles the cities of Seaside and Marina, which are small, diverse communities where many of our students live and work. We also offer online programs for those who don't live in the area.
